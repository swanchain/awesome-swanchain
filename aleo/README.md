# Aleo Network

Aleo is a privacy-oriented blockchain platform project dedicated to providing highly privacy-protecting smart contracts and decentralized applications. 
By using cryptography techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, users are allowed to verify the validity and rationality of private data without revealing the original data. 
That is to say, the generation of zero-knowledge proofs under the chain is realized, and the efficient verification of zero-knowledge proofs (simplicity of transactions) is realized on the chain.
